Matt's been messing around with AFNetworking.  This is the result.

Nothing says iOS like another generic Twitter client.

Here I've used AFNetworking to fetch tweets from Twitter's REST API and
display information about them on the device.  It is a very basic
implementaiton that only supports ONE tweet at a time, from any random
tweeter in the world.

Pretty basic, huh?  It won't win any design awards.
